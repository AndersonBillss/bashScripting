        <h2>Where to Eat</h2>
        <p>This is not the aspirational fliff of instagram wall neon; it's fact. Recent surveys hace shown that a majority of travelers consider food first when planning a trip, even ahead of where they sleep. Add to this that people are traveling more than ever before - earthlings ligged a record-breaking 1.4 billion international trips last year - and it's safe to say that the hunger for new culinary experiences is more ravenous than ever.</p>
        <p>While the endlessly alluring bistros of Paris, izakayas of Tokyo, shawarma stands of Tel Aviv, and tasting menus of Mexico City will always top many peoples' list of cravings, we're continually on the lookout for something new to fill our bellies, our passports, and our feeds.</p>
